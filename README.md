# spme-gui
ArgosModel editor

Based on my [older version](https://github.com/GoombaProgrammer/spmodeledit)

# Why would I edit a NMT model?
Well, maybe you want to fix a typo that appears 100000 times in the dataset it got trained on, or you just want to create some relexed conlang. idk.

# How does this work?
I fully found out how the SentencePiece and OpenNMT checkpoints work myself, how? well I just looked at the binary data, and I tried modifying some parts.

Note that this is not gauranteed to work.

# Features
